PyBer Project is based on the ride-sharing data from January to April 2019. We took this four months' data and calculated: 
•	Total Rides, 
•	Total Drivers, 
•	Total Fares 
•	average Fare Per Ride and 
•	average Fare Per Driver. 
We summarized the data between three city types, i.e., Urban, Suburban, and Rural; to recommend that the CEO of PyBer address any disparities and make future recommendations through our analysis.

                                                     #Analysis

From the Pyper data summary, we can see the highest number of total rides and fares are from Urban cities, which are 1625 rides and $39,854 fares, respectively. Although it is a very high number compared to other cities, if we pay attention in rural towns, the average fare per ride is $34.2, and the driver is $55.49, which is higher than in the Urban city.

Fare by city type summary below depicts in mid of February all the three cities fares had an incline and beginning of march they declined. It also shows that all three cities are maintaining parallel channels with each other.

We have the following pie charts to look further in our analysis:

urban cities generate 63%, 30.5% suburban urban, and 6.8% rural.

From this analysis, we can predict:
•	Urban city riders take frequent shorter distance rides, whereas rural areas take longer rides, causing Urban average fares per driver to be lower. 
•	The urban city has an abundance of rides. Vs. Rural areas, causing the average fare per ride lower in the urban city.
•	There also might be ride share attributes that cause average fares to be lower in urban cities.

                                                        #Summary

The analysis looks promising for growth in PyBer. We propose a few recommendations to increase future ridership:

•	Implement more drivers so rides are more accessible and fare gets cheaper in suburban and rural areas.

•	Introduce new discount programs such as first few rides discounts, holiday discounts, and senior discounts to promote Pyber.

•	Introduce ride share in rural and suburban areas so fares are much more acceptable and riders feel comfortable not being costly.
